# GOO POEM
*[Live at palmdrop.github.io](https://palmdrop.github.io/goo-poem/)*

An experimental poetry/design/narrative project. 

So far, there's only a swedish version of the poem. Might make an english version at some point.

## TODO
- [ ] Text morph effect does not work properly on safari when combined with CSS keyframes. Refactor to use js-animated CSS variable instead.
